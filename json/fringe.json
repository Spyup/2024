Except for online conferences held during the pandemic in 2020-2021, the events have always taken place in Europe. Therefore, the Asian community attempted to hold the LibreOffice Conference Indonesia in 2018, which was a huge success. Subsequently, the Asian and Latin American communities held the LibreOffice Asia and LibreOffice LATAM Conference respectively in 2019. The LibreOffice Asia Conference was paused due to the pandemic from 2020 and resumed in Indonesia in 2023.\n\nUnlike the LibreOffice Conference in Europe, which focuses heavily on development agendas, the content of the LibreOffice conferences in Asia and Latin America emphasizes community building and promotion. For example, the LibreOffice LATAM Conference held in Mexico City in 2023 invited Franklin Weng, the president of the Software Liberty Association Taiwan, to share Taiwan's promotion experiences and to exchange insights with the team promoting ODF/LibreOffice within the Mexican government.\n\nThis year's LibreOffice Asia Conference will be divided into two main topics:\n- The first day, Aug. 2, is \"Government Day,\" focusing on \"Government Promotion and Implementation,\" discussing theories, practices, and experience exchanges on implementing ODF and PMPC policies within government units.\n- The second day is \"Community Day,\" centered on community sharing agendas. Co-organized with this year's COSCUP (Conference for Open Source Coders, Users, and Promoters), the agenda includes certified trainers from The Document Foundation in Taiwan sharing their teaching experiences and engaging in community management exchanges with international participants.","zh-TW":"文件基金會自 2011 年起每年都舉辦 LibreOffice Conference ，除了 2020-2021 疫情期間舉辦線上研討會以外，其他時間都在歐洲舉行。有鑒於此，2018 年亞洲社群嘗試在印尼舉行 LibreOffice Conference Indonesia 獲得不錯的迴響，隨後亞洲社群與拉丁美洲社群於 2019 年分別舉行 LibreOffice Asia 與 LibreOffice LATAM Conference 。LibreOffice Asia自2020起因疫情停辦數年，於 2023年恢復在印尼舉辦。\n有別於歐洲的 LibreOffice conference 開發議程佔較多，亞洲與拉丁美洲的 LibreOffice 研討會內容比較著重在社群、推廣等等。例如去年 2023 年在墨西哥市舉辦的拉丁美洲 LibreOffice LATAM Conference 就邀請中華民國軟體自由協會理事長翁佳驥前往分享台灣推廣經驗，並與墨西哥政府內推廣 ODF/LibreOffice 的團隊進行交流。\n\n今年度的 LibreOffice Asia Conference 將分成兩大主題：\n    • 第一天為「政府日」，主題為「政府推廣與導入」，討論在政府單位導入 ODF 與 PMPC（公共程式）政策的理論、實務與經驗交流。\n    • 第二天為「社群日」：以社群分享議程為主。與今年度的 COSCUP開源人年會一起合辦，在此研討會的議程中會請到台灣的文件基金會認證訓練專家（講師群）分享他們的教學經驗，還有國外社群經營等等交流分享。"},"contact":"Franklin Weng 翁佳驥","email":"franklin@slat.org","logo":"/2024/images/fringe/libreoffice.png"},{"id":"internationalbof","title":{"en":"International Exchanges BoF - Cross community Gathering","zh-TW":"International Exchanges BoF - Cross community Gathering"},"description":{"en":"03 Aug 2024, 19:00 - 22:00\nSite: 23 Public | Craft Beer\nAddress: No. 332, Section 2, Fuxing S Rd, Da’an District, Taipei City, 106[Google Maps]\n\n(This is a self-paid event. 23 Public has vegetarian and non-alcoholic options.)\nThere are participants from different countries joining COSCUP this year.
